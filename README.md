# Protocol for Simulations of PEGylated Proteins with Martini 3 (Tutorial Files)
This repository comprises all input files required to run our [tutorial](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-0892-0_18) on simulating PEGylated proteins. 

## Abstract
Enhancement of proteins by PEGylation is an active area of research. However, the interactions between polymer and protein are far from fully understood. To gain a better insight into these interactions or even make predictions, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be applied to study specific protein-polymer systems at molecular level detail. Here we present instructions on how to simulate PEGylated proteins using the latest iteration of the Martini coarse-grained (CG) force-field. CG MD simulations offer near atomistic information and at the same time allow to study complex biological systems over longer time and length scales than fully atomistic-level simulations.

## Usage Notes
 - run the commands within the downloaded directory
 - if you run on MacOS or Windows you need to adjust the shell commands
